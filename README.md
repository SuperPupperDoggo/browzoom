Automatically show the 'Join from browser' link on zoom


This is for those of you who either can't or don't want to install zoom on their computer. Do you find it annoying that you have to hassle with zoom just to get it to show the link that lets you join from the browser instead? Then this extension is for you. It will simply show tell the page to show join from browser link when you open it, so you can click it and move on with your day. This extension is lightweight, open-source, and easy to understand, inside and out.

DISCLAIMER: This Extension was not created by Zoom or anyone relating to Zoom. Thus it is technically a 3rd-party add-on. If this extension starts causing problems, do NOT contact zoom about it unless you know it is an issue without the Extension too(disable the extension and re-open the join link).
